# Hooli-style Popup

Kottans "HTML & CSS" Practice

### Project Constrains:

- **no JavaScript, only HTML/CSS, use of preprocessors is allowed**
- no external libraries or frameworks
- browser support: Chrome only (feel free to use latest features)
- the popup is expected to have three states depending on user actions:
  - **initial state:** popup menu is not visible
  - **upon click on popup-button:** the popup menu gets visible or gets hidden if already open
  - **click on "More" button:** adds 3 to 10 more icons and makes the content of the popup scrollable
- mobile view is irrelevant for this task
- Make sure that your navigation is built with all _semantic_ rules
- Avoid external scripts for the font icons
- Check your preview in the [validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- All interactive elements should be marked as such on mouse hover
- All interactive elements should have _:focus_ state
- You must be able to switch across all interactive elements using only keyboard (without a mouse, don't forget about styles for _:focus_ state)
